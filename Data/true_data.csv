i hope this email finds you well i am writing to express my concerns regarding the consistently increasing amount on my recent bills despite the inclusion of the rebate that was previously applied as a valued customer of bses i have always appreciated the reliable service and the efforts made by your company to provide costeffective solutions however i have noticed a steady rise in my bill amount over the past few months even after considering the rebate that was initially applied i have taken several measures to ensure energy efficiency in my household including using energysaving appliances implementing conservation practices and monitoring my energy consumption despite these efforts my bills continue to escalate which is causing significant financial strain i kindly request your assistance in evaluating my billing statement and identifying the factors contributing to the increasing costs i would appreciate a detailed breakdown of the charges including any changes in rates fees or additional services that may have been added without my knowledge furthermore i would like to inquire about the status of the rebate that was previously applied to my account has there been any change in the rebate program or its terms and conditions that could explain the discrepancy between the expected reduction in my bill amount and the actual figures i understand that maintaining accurate billing records and providing quality service are top priorities for utility companys name therefore i kindly request a thorough investigation into this matter and a prompt resolution to address the increasing bill amount i value the services provided by your company and believe in the importance of open communication and transparency in resolving customer concerns i trust that you will take this matter seriously and work towards a satisfactory resolution thank you for your attention to this matter i look forward to your prompt response and a resolution that addresses my concerns customer namesumitra sharma ca no 152597897,1

hi bses how can you debit amount from my account when the connection is not registered with my name,1
i hope this email finds you well i am writing to express my concerns regarding the consistently increasing amount on my recent bills despite the inclusion of the rebate that was previously applied as a valued customer of bses i have always appreciated the reliable service and the efforts made by your company to provide costeffective solutions however i have noticed a steady rise in my bill amount over the past few months even after considering the rebate that was initially applied i have taken several measures to ensure energy efficiency in my household including using energysaving appliances implementing conservation practices and monitoring my energy consumption despite these efforts my bills continue to escalate which is causing significant financial strain i kindly request your assistance in evaluating my billing statement and identifying the factors contributing to the increasing costs i would appreciate a detailed breakdown of the charges including any changes in rates fees or additional services that may have been added without my knowledge furthermore i would like to inquire about the status of the rebate that was previously applied to my account has there been any change in the rebate program or its terms and conditions that could explain the discrepancy between the expected reduction in my bill amount and the actual figures i understand that maintaining accurate billing records and providing quality service are top priorities for utility companys name therefore i kindly request a thorough investigation into this matter and a prompt resolution to address the increasing bill amount i value the services provided by your company and believe in the importance of open communication and transparency in resolving customer concerns i trust that you will take this matter seriously and work towards a satisfactory resolution thank you for your attention to this matter i look forward to your prompt response and a resolution that addresses my concerns customer namesumitra sharma ca no 152597897,1

respected mr amal sinha greeting for the day i am writing to bring to your attention a pressing matter that requires immediate intervention despite multiple attempts my application for an electricity meter with bses has been rejected repeatedly causing different unwanted errors even there us one person who name is mr ajit asking money for installation the meter having gone through the proper procedures and submitted all the necessary documents it is disheartening to face repeated rejections without any clear explanation as a lawabiding citizen i believe it is my right to access uninterrupted electricity supply and the continuous denial of a new meter puts an undue burden on me and my household i kindly request your assistance in addressing this issue and ensuring that my application is reviewed thoroughly and fairly timely resolution of this matter would greatly alleviate the difficulties my family and i have been facing due to the absence of a functional electricity meter i am also copying the chief ministers respected mr arvind kejriwal sir office on this email in the hopes that their intervention will expedite the process and bring about a swift resolution to this matter thank you for your attention to this matter i would appreciate your prompt response and assistance in resolving this situation my all details is mentioned below,1

hi bses how can you debit amount from my account when the connection is not registered with my name,1
i hope this email finds you well i am writing to express my concerns regarding the consistently increasing amount on my recent bills despite the inclusion of the rebate that was previously applied as a valued customer of bses i have always appreciated the reliable service and the efforts made by your company to provide costeffective solutions however i have noticed a steady rise in my bill amount over the past few months even after considering the rebate that was initially applied i have taken several measures to ensure energy efficiency in my household including using energysaving appliances implementing conservation practices and monitoring my energy consumption despite these efforts my bills continue to escalate which is causing significant financial strain i kindly request your assistance in evaluating my billing statement and identifying the factors contributing to the increasing costs i would appreciate a detailed breakdown of the charges including any changes in rates fees or additional services that may have been added without my knowledge furthermore i would like to inquire about the status of the rebate that was previously applied to my account has there been any change in the rebate program or its terms and conditions that could explain the discrepancy between the expected reduction in my bill amount and the actual figures i understand that maintaining accurate billing records and providing quality service are top priorities for utility companys name therefore i kindly request a thorough investigation into this matter and a prompt resolution to address the increasing bill amount i value the services provided by your company and believe in the importance of open communication and transparency in resolving customer concerns i trust that you will take this matter seriously and work towards a satisfactory resolution thank you for your attention to this matter i look forward to your prompt response and a resolution that addresses my concerns customer namesumitra sharma ca no 152597897,1

respected mr amal sinha greeting for the day i am writing to bring to your attention a pressing matter that requires immediate intervention despite multiple attempts my application for an electricity meter with bses has been rejected repeatedly causing different unwanted errors even there us one person who name is mr ajit asking money for installation the meter having gone through the proper procedures and submitted all the necessary documents it is disheartening to face repeated rejections without any clear explanation as a lawabiding citizen i believe it is my right to access uninterrupted electricity supply and the continuous denial of a new meter puts an undue burden on me and my household i kindly request your assistance in addressing this issue and ensuring that my application is reviewed thoroughly and fairly timely resolution of this matter would greatly alleviate the difficulties my family and i have been facing due to the absence of a functional electricity meter i am also copying the chief ministers respected mr arvind kejriwal sir office on this email in the hopes that their intervention will expedite the process and bring about a swift resolution to this matter thank you for your attention to this matter i would appreciate your prompt response and assistance in resolving this situation my all details is mentioned below,1
